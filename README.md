Public repository for the primary mortality analysis of the NAITRE trial: Neonates and Azithromycin: An Innovation in the Treatment of Children

## Description

This repo includes the R code to complete all analyses for the article:

_Neonatal Azithromycin Administration for Prevention of Infant Mortality_, Oldenburg et al. _NEJM_ 2022.

This repo is mirrored on the Open Science Framework (OSF), where we have additionally archived the study's datasets and computational notebook output files: https://osf.io/ujeyb/

## To run the analyses

1. Clone this repository
2. Download the two analysis datasets from https://osf.io/ujeyb/. Save the datasets in a subdirectory named: `NAITRE-primary/data/final` 
3. Create a subdirectory to save the analysis output: `NAITRE-primary/output/`
4. Run the `.Rmd` files in the  `NAITRE-primary/code/analysis` directory.  They will generate `.html` files in the output directory with the results.

We have archived the `.html` output files from the final analysis as associated files for release 1 of this repository and also on OSF.

## System Requirements

All analyses were run using R software version 4.1.1 on Mac OSX Catalina using the RStudio IDE (https://www.rstudio.com).
